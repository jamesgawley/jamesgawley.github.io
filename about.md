I am a PhD candidate in the Classics Department at UB, and a former Adjunct Instructor of Humanities at Miami-Dade College. I study idea transmission in the ancient world, specifically the allusions found in epic poetry. My approach combines philology with computational linguistics and cognitive science. 

Courses I have taught include <em>Introduction to Humanities</em, <em>Heroes in the Ancient and Modern World</em>, and <em>Latin</em> (102 and 202).
